## Features

- Explore an interactive 3D city environment with autonomously moving cars.
- Experience three different time modes: Morning, Afternoon, and Night, each with its unique lighting and atmosphere.
- Intuitive camera controls allow you to freely navigate and explore the city from various angles.
- Realistic lighting effects, including spotlights that illuminate the cars during nighttime.
- Easily adjustable settings using the dat.GUI interface.

## Usage
